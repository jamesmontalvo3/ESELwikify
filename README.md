ESELwikify
==========

ESELwikify is a crude implementation of the Spreadsheet_Excel_Reader.php library which allows
you to generate MediaWiki wikitext from ESEL spreadsheets. Due to lack of consistency between
ESELs, it does not work for all. Furthermore, it only works on .xls files, not .xlsx files.

The main purpose of this repository is to demonstrate the use of Spreadsheet_Excel_Reader.php.
Major improvements could be made to this code, including using a better Excel conversion
library, capable of .xlsx format.
